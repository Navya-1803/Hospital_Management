# Hospital_Management
A database-driven hospital management system built as part of our college DBMS project. This project was developed by a team of two and includes functionalities for managing patients, doctors, appointments, staff, rooms, and billing. It uses MySQL for backend data storage and Python (Tkinter) for the GUI frontend.
